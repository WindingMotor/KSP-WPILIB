# ðŸš€ KSP-WPILIB Training System
#### Note: The wrapper is not fully complete and is still in testing!

A training platform that combines Kerbal Space Program (KSP) with WPILib to create an accessible environment for learning FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) programming concepts. This project provides a wrapper for kRPC that allows programmers to control KSP rockets using familiar WPILib command-based programming patterns.

## Overview

This training system bridges the gap between learning robotics programming and practical implementation by:
- Providing a safe, virtual environment for testing control systems
- Using familiar FRC programming patterns and tools
- Offering real-time feedback through KSP's visual interface
- Enabling experimentation with PID control and command-based programming

## Prerequisites

- WPILib 2024.3.2 or newer (2025 beta coming soon)
- Java 17 or newer
- Kerbal Space Program
- kRPC mod for KSP
- FIRST Robotics Competition VSCode extension

## Getting Started

1. Install Kerbal Space Program and the kRPC mod
2. Clone this repository
3. Start kRPC server and create a RocketSubsystem class
4. Spawn a vessel in KSP then start the WPILIB Simulator
